# Real Estate Marketplace

In this project you will be minting your own tokens to represent your title to the properties. Before you mint a token, you need to verify you own the property. You will use zk-SNARKs to create a verification system which can prove you have title to the property without revealing that specific information on the property.

Once the token has been verified you will place it on a blockchain market place (OpenSea) for others to purchase.
